# Hybrid Recommendation System with Neural Network 

Built hybrid recommendation system by combining Content-Based (Video Information), Collaborative Filtering (User Interaction), and Knowledge-Based (Personal information) for recommending videos and movies to the user.

**Recommendation Systems:** Recommendation Systems are models that predict usersâ€™ preferences over multiple products. They are used in a variety of areas, like video and music services, e-commerce, and social media platforms.

The most common methods leverage product features (Content-Based), user similarity (Collaborative Filtering), personal information (Knowledge-Based). However, with the increasing popularity of Neural Networks, companies have started experimenting with new hybrid Recommendation Systems that combine them all.

## Project Flow

- Setup: import packages, read data, preprocessing
- Solving Cold Start problem
- Content-Based methods with tensorflow and numpy
- Traditional Collaborative Filtering and Neural Collaborative Filtering with tensorflow/keras
- Hybrid (context-aware) model with tensorflow/keras
